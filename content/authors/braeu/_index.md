In my master thesis, I will develop a model that estimates global properties like the entanglement entropy of a quantum system based on few measurement samples. To achieve this, I will use machine learning techniques with a focus on graph neural networks. A central objective will be scalability, which is a crucial aspect in the characterization of complex quantum systems.
