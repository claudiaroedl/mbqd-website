abstract = {We investigate the information extractable from measurement distributions of two non-commuting spin observables in a multi-well spin-1 Bose–Einstein condensate. We provide a variety of analytic and numerical evidence that suitably chosen classical entropies and classical mutual informations thereof contain the typical feature of quantum entropies known in quantum field theories, that is, the area law, even in the non-Gaussian regime and for a non-zero temperature. Towards a feasible experimental implementation, we estimate entropic quantities from a finite number of samples without any additional assumptions on the underlying quantum state using k-nearest neighbor estimators.}
