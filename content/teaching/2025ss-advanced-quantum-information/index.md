This lecture introduces core physical and mathematical concepts in quantum computing and quantum information theory. An emphasis is put on various aspects of quantum computing, including quantum algorithms and computing models as well as quantum computational complexity theory. Different physical platforms for quantum computing and relevant physical concepts are introduced. This also includes the discussion of typical errors and their description using the formalism of open quantum systems as well as quantum error correction techniques. Weekly exercises will include programming exercises, in which a quantum circuit simulator will be developed.
